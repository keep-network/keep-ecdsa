// Constants related with network.

// In order to communicate, nodes in the network should have a connection
// between them. Basically a node can:
// - receive a connection from another peer
// - automatically open a connection to another peer
//   during core bootstrap round
// - automatically open a connection to another peer
// 	 after routing table refresh (DHT bootstrap round)
//
// Ideally, each node in the network should have a connection with all
// other nodes or at least be aware of their existence. This strongly depends
// on the actual network topology but some parameters can be fine-tuned
// in order to improve the behavior of the network.
const (
	// routingTableRefreshPeriod determines the frequency of routing table
	// refreshes. Routing table is actually a structure which contains
	// transport identifiers of other network peers along with their
	// addresses. A refresh of the routing table is basically a query
	// sent to connected peers asking about new entries from their routing
	// tables. If the node receives an information about new peers it will
	// try to connect them automatically.
	//
	// The refresh period should be set to a value which will
	// allow to keep the routing table up to date with the actual
	// network state. Bear in mind a smaller value may not have sense
	// as changes in the network need some time to propagate and frequent
	// refreshes can increase resource consumption and network congestion.

	// is less than the minimum, new connection attempts will be performed
	// against peers listed in config (`LibP2P.Peers`).
