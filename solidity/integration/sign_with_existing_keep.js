This test validates integration between on-chain contracts and off-chain client.
It requires contracts to be deployed before running the test. It requests
signature for a specific keep contract provided as a KEEP_ADDRESS environment
variable using keep owner (privileged application) provided as a KEEP_OWNER
environment variable.

To execute this test run:
  KEEP_ADDRESS=<KEEP_ADDRESS> \
  KEEP_OWNER=<KEEP_OWNER> \
  truffle exec integration/sign_with_existing_keep.js --network local
