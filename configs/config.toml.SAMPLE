	# MiningCheckInterval is the interval in which transaction
	# mining status is checked. If the transaction is not mined within this
	# time, the gas price is increased and transaction is resubmitted.
	#
	# MiningCheckInterval = 60  # 60 sec (default value)

	# MaxGasPrice specifies the default maximum gas price the client is
	# willing to pay for the transaction to be mined. The offered transaction
	# gas price can not be higher than the max gas price value. If the maximum
	# allowed gas price is reached, no further resubmission attempts are
	# performed.A value can be provided in `wei`, `Gwei` or `ether`, e.g.

  # Uncomment to enable Ethereum node rate limiting. Both properties can be

	#
	# ConcurrencyLimit = 30
	#
	# BalanceAlertThreshold defines a minimum value of the operator's account
	# balance below which the client will start reporting errors in logs.

#  PreParamsGenerationTimeout = "2m30s"

# TSS pre-parameters target pool size. This value determines the number of
# pre-parameters that should be generated and kept at hand ready to use.
# That value should be set reasonably because a low target pool size may force
# the client to generate parameters during protocol executions and cause unwanted
# delays. On the other hand, a big target pool size can cause high CPU usage for
# a long time. The default value of this parameter is `20`.
