	// When transactions are submitted, they require a valid nonce. The nonce is
	// equal to the count of transactions the account has submitted so far, and

	// any previous submitted transaction. To do this, transaction submission
	// asks the Ethereum client it is connected to for the next pending nonce,

	// transactions are submitted in short order, they may all get the same
	// nonce. Serializing submission ensures that each nonce is requested after
	// a previous transaction has been submitted.
