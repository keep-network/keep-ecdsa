== Lazy non-interactive sortition

- Each privileged customer has its own sortition pool
and eligibility is checked when an operator is selected,
rejecting and removing ineligible operators from the pool
- Non-interactive sortition requires significant optimization
even with logarithmic data structures,
but once optimized is easily scalable for larger _n_
- Requires significant implementation work
- Provides instant results once the seed is received
and is less affected by censorship,
although malicious miners can still censor DKG result submissions

A logarithmic data structure could be used
to store the pool of eligible operators,
weighted by their stakes.
Sortition from the pool would be performed
without waiting for input from operators.

=== Lazy eligibility evaluation

Each pair of (keep factory, privileged customer)
would require its own sortition pool.
An operator enters a sortition pool by opting in.
The pool checks their eligible tokens
(including operator status and authorization to slash stakes),
and available bonding currency
(including authorization to seize bonds).
The operator pays the transaction fees for the pool update.

Keeping these pools up to date cannot be done eagerly
as proliferation of privileged customers
could be used to perform DOS attacks
by increasing the cost of such updates.
When a sortition pool prospectively selects an operator,
the selected operator's eligibility status and weight are checked
and, if necessary, updated in the sortition pool.
If the changes would be detrimental to the operator,
the operator selection is performed again with the updated input
to ensure correctness.

The number of operator selections required to get _n_ valid members
averages _n / (1 - e)_
where _e_ equals the fraction of weight in the pool
belonging to operators whose information is detrimentally out of date.
If 50% of the pool weight is outdated,
the average number of selections is 6,
roughly 2% of ECDSA keeps would require 12 or more operator selections,
and more than 20 selections would be extremely rare.
Sortition pools that are used more often would be less outdated.

=== Optimizing data structures

Even though logarithmic data structures are well-known,
the particular characteristics of Ethereum smart contracts
require specialized optimization
to make non-interactive sortition viable.

To enable weighted sortition,
each sortition pool would have a weighted tree
where each leaf stores an operator
and is labeled with the operator's sortition weight,
and each branch is labeled with the sum of the weights of its children.
To select an operator from the pool,
a pseudorandom number in _[0, W)_
(where _W_ is the total sortition weight of the tree)
is acquired and used to index into the tree.

==== Background

A single storage field in the EVM consists of 256 bits/32 bytes.
Data structures on the EVM are naturally sparse.
An implicit heap can eliminate the need for pointers
so the full capacity of each storage field can be used for content data.

KEEP tokens have 18 decimals and the total supply is 1,000,000,000 KEEP.
A precise token amount would require roughly 96 bits/12 bytes to store.
However, the minimum stake required to participate
is expected to be in the region of 1/100,000 of the total KEEP supply.

==== Unoptimized binary trees

Only a binary tree is possible with precise token amounts.
Even with a conservative estimate of minimum stake
at 62,000 KEEP (more than 1/16,384 of all KEEP)
the number of possible virtual stakers is roughly 2^14^.
The number of KEEP owned by each account
is expected to follow a power law distribution,
and the number of accounts holding at least 1/2^14^ of the total
is expected to be approximately 2^11^ to 2^14^.
Again taking the optimal case gives a height of 11 for a binary tree.
Updating a single node in the tree,
along with its path from the root,
would require up to 14 write operations at a cost of 55,000 ~ 70,000 gas.
Accessing a node in the tree
would similarly require up to 14 read operations at 8,800 ~ 11,200 gas.

==== Optimized higher arity trees

Instead of using the exact token amount,
each operator's sortition weight should use their staker weight
as in the Random Beacon group selection.
Because a staker weight exceeding 65,535
would represent catastrophic centralization in the network,
16 bits is sufficient for all practical purposes
even if the minimum stake is somewhat less than 10,000 KEEP.

A storage field can hold 16 values of 16 bits.
This gives a theoretical ceiling of 1,048,560 possible virtual stakers
for a node containing the weights of its 16 children. 
With a pessimal distribution of child nodes' weights,
524,288 virtual stakers can be accommodated.
The maximum permitted staker weight of 65,535
represents approximately 13% of all tokens in the pessimal distribution.
Assuming each staker divides their staked tokens
equally between two different operators
as recommended for smooth upgrades,
a single actor following best practices would need to hold 25% of all KEEP
to be affected by the staker weight cap of 16 bits.
Such an actor would already be a threat to the Keep network
and we have no need to accommodate them,
so all child nodes can be capped to 16 bits without issues.

===== Version A: up to 524,288 virtual stakers

If the tree is instead packed optimally using `uint16`,
we get the following numbers of nodes per level:

. 1
. 16
. 256
. 4,096
. 65,536
. 1,048,576

A 16-ary tree of height 6 is sufficient to hold all possible operators
within the limits of the pessimal distribution of 16-bit weights.
Updating a path in this tree would only use up to 30,000 gas,
and accessing a node would cost at most 4,800 gas.

The minimum stake must be at least 1,910 KEEP.

A branch node consists of `{uint16[16] children}`
where each field is the weight of its corresponding child.
A weight of `0` means the child node is empty.

A leaf node consists of `{uint16 weight; address operator}`.

==== Metadata

===== Empty node locations

To help insert operators into the tree,
there should be lists for levels 2 to 5 (_version A_)
containing the branches with empty children on that level.

===== Operators' tree positions?

In addition to the weighted tree,
a sortition pool must have a `mapping(address operator => uint) treePosition`
to help locate operators in the tree and prevent duplicate insertions.

==== Operations

===== Insertion

Inserting a new operator into the tree
is performed in the leftmost empty node of the appropriate level
whose level 2 ancestor's weight would not overflow
from the addition of the new operator.
The weights of the node's ancestors are updated,
and if the parent node's children are now full
it is removed from the list of branches with empty children.

===== Selection

The total weight of the tree _W_ can either be stored separately
or calculated by summing the weights of the root's children.

An entry _V_ is requested from the Random Beacon,
and an index _i_ in the range _[0, W)_ is derived from _V_
using a standard algorithm for secure integers in an arbitrary interval.
Using `i = V % W` is not safe and will lead to biasing the results,
summoning demons from hell,
and embarrassing the entire company on Twitter and Hacker News.

At a branch node,
if _i_ is less than the first child's weight _w~1~_
the first child is entered;
otherwise _i -= w~1~_
and is compared to the second child's weight _w~2~_
and so on until a leaf is reached.

The address _P_ in the leaf is the _prospective selected operator_,
with weight _w~P~_.

The staking contract is queried to get the eligible stake of _P_,
and the up-to-date weight _W'~P~_ is calculated.

If _W'~P~ = W~P~_, the weight is up to date and we proceed.

If _W'~P~ > W~P~_, something funny is going on
because the current spec doesn't include
increasing the staked tokens of an operator after the operator has been created
but if this is the future and we're doing that now
we proceed but also queue the weight for updating.

If _W'~P~ < W~P~_, we queue the weight for updating
and because the update would be in a direction detrimental to the operator,
we also queue a new operator selection with the same _i_
once we're done with the update.
If _W'~P~ == 0_, the operator _P_ is queued for deletion
and we don't bother querying the bond.

Then we query the bonding contract to get the available bond _B~P~_
and compare it to the minimum bond _B_:

If _B~P~ < B_, we queue the operator for deletion
and queue a new selection with _i_
after _P_ is deleted from the sortition pool.

If _B~P~ >= B_ and we previously queued a new selection,
we perform the queued update and selection.

If _B =< B~P~ < 2B_ and we previously proceeded,
the operator _P_ is selected but they don't have enough bond to stay eligible
so _P_ is deleted from the sortition pool.

If _B~P~ >= 2B_ and we previously proceeded,
the operator _P_ is selected and they have enough bond to stay in the pool.
We then perform queued updates, if any.

=== Batched keep creation

Unlike ticket-based selection,
selecting a larger number of members at once
does not have a significant impact on tree-based sortition pools.
